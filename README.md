# HailInstaller
Magisk / KSU-Next Module for install <a href="https://github.com/aistra0528/Hail/">Hail</a> to ``/system/product/priv-app/`` or ``/product/priv-app/`` on Android.

## Why release Module?
this Magisk / KSU-Next module makes Hail run as a Privileged System App, this module is simple and easy way to install Hail as a System App or for beginners who don't know how to install or run Hail as a System App.

running Hail as a System App is less RAM usage, fewer process, less problem and reliable every time, run seamless because no third party/other app are needed to grant permission. just set work mode "system app - disable" in Hail settings.

and this module is a temporary solution because the goal is to create flashable .zip file to install on system persistently and seamlessly with OTA Update. and .zip files can be flashed using a custom recovery or adb sideload (However, I'm still struggling find a source for building a flashable .zip file)
